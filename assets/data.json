In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This has then led to the creaton of the COBOL language, beacuse of her idea of a language being based on English words. "

Feinler, the used to be Director of the Network Information Systems Center at the Stanford Research Institute, created ARPANET for the Adb=vanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which was part of the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPANET became the first prototype model of the INternet as it was able to connect multiple computers together and later the idea was expanded upon by later inventors and scientists to create what we know call the Internet today. Because of her research, in 2012 she was inducted into the INternet Hall of Fame by trh Internet Society. She wil be forever remembered in the hall of fame for being the one to create the first 'Internet' of its time"

      {"name": "Integer",
        "definition": "An integer data type represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers and different programming languages.",

      {"name": "Float", "definition": "A floating-point or float is a variable type that is used to store floating-point number values. A floating-point number is one where the position of the decimal point can \"float\" rather than being in a fixed position within a number.",
        "example": "2.3, 5.234, -3.1415"},
      {"name": "Char",
        "definition": "A character is a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol. This relies on the general definition of a character as a single unit of written speech.",

If the variable is an integer 2, it will be true, because any number that is not zero will be true. If the condition is true, then an action occurs. If the condition is false, take an alternate action",

    "Loops": [
      {"name": "For loop",
        "definition": "A for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly. A for loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable, which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. For loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. For loops can be thought of as shorthands for while loops which increment and test a loop variable.",
        "example": "For counter = 0, counter < 5, counter += 1\n    Output \"I love ice cream!\""},
      {"name": "While loop",
