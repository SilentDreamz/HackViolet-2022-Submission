          "explanation": "A rear admiral in the U.S. navy who helped devise UNIVAC 1 and naval applications for COBOL. She helped create Mark 1 which was the first automatic precursor to the calculator and the first computer manual called A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (1946) for Mark 1."

          "explanation": "Sometime in 1949 Hopper joined Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp., where she designed one of the first compilers and coined the term 'compiler.' In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This has then led to the creaton of the COBOL language, beacuse of her idea of a language being based on English words. "

      "conclusion": "Elizabeth J. Feinler, the used to be Director of the Network Information Systems Center at the Stanford Research Institute, created ARPANET for the Adb=vanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which was part of the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPANET became the first prototype model of the INternet as it was able to connect multiple computers together and later the idea was expanded upon by later inventors and scientists to create what we know call the Internet today. Because of her research, in 2012 she was inducted into the INternet Hall of Fame by trh Internet Society. She wil be forever remembered in the hall of fame for being the one to create the first 'Internet' of its time"
